# Services Provider

WP Bones implements and provides several WordPress services such as Ajax, Shortcodes, Custom Post Types, and so on. Most of these services are handled by the `config/plugin.php` file.

<Callout type="info">
  The `config/plugin.php` file is the main configuration file of the plugin. It is the place where you can define the plugin name, version, and other settings.
</Callout>

## Write your own Service

<Steps>

### Create a new Service Provider

You may create your own service by following the steps below:

```sh copy
php bones make:provider MyProvider
```

By default, the new provider will be created in the `plugins/Providers` directory.
Of course, you may create your Service Provider manually and in any directory you prefer.
You have to change the namespace accordingly.

### Edit the Service Provider bootstrap

```php copy
<?php

namespace WPKirk\Providers;

if (! defined('ABSPATH')) {
    exit;
}

use WPKirk\WPBones\Support\ServiceProvider;

class MyProvider extends ServiceProvider
{

  public function register()
  {
    // TODO
  }
}
```

In the `register` method, you can define the actions, filters, and other services you require.

### Load the Service Provider

The ServiceProvider gets loaded through the `config/plugin.php` file.

```php copy
  /*
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Autoload Service Providers
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | The service providers listed here will be automatically loaded on the
  | initialization of your plugin. Feel free to add your own services to
  | this array to provide expanded functionality to your applications.
  |
  */

  "providers" => [
    "WPKirk\Providers\MyProvider",
  ],
```

</Steps>
