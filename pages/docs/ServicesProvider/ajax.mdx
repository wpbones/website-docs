# Ajax

In WordPress, you can have three different Ajax access:

-  Only for logged-in users
-  Only for not-logged-in users
-  For everyone

## Create an Ajax Service Provider

To create an Ajax Service Provider, you can use the following command:

```sh copy
php bones make:ajax MyAjax
```

By default, the new provider will be created in the `plugins/Ajax` directory. Of course, you may create your Service Provider manually and in any directory you prefer. You have to change the namespace accordingly.

```php filename="/plugin/Ajax/MyAjax.php" copy
<?php
class MyAjax extends WordPressAjaxServiceProvider
{
  /**
   * List of the ajax actions executed by both logged and not logged users.
   * Here you will use a methods list.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $trusted = ["trusted"];

  /**
   * List of the ajax actions executed only by logged-in users.
   * Here you will use a methods list.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $logged = ["logged"];

  /**
   * List of the ajax actions executed only by the not logged-in user, usually from the frontend.
   * Here you will use a methods list.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $notLogged = ["notLogged"];

  /**
   * You may also define the capability required to execute the action.
   */
  protected $capability = "manage_options";

  /**
   * The nonce key used to verify the request.
   *
   * @var string
   */
  protected $nonceKey = "nonce";

  /**
   * The nonce hash used to verify the request.
   *
   * @var string
   */
  protected $nonceHash = "";
}
```


## Edit the Ajax Service Provider

In the `\WPKirk\Ajax\MyAjax` class, you will list your methods/actions for logged-in, not logged-in, or trusted users:

The parent class `WordPressAjaxServiceProvider` will register on your behalf the WordPress actions that you need. So, let's have a look at a complete example:

```php copy
<?php
namespace WPKirk\Ajax;

use WPKirk\WPBones\Foundation\WordPressAjaxServiceProvider;

class MyAjax extends WordPressAjaxServiceProvider
{
  /**
   * List of the AJAX actions executed by both logged-in and not logged-in users.
   * Here you will use a methods list.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $trusted = ["trusted"];

  /**
   * List of the AJAX actions executed only by logged-in users.
   * Here you will use a methods list.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $logged = ["logged"];

  /**
   * List of the AJAX actions executed only by the not logged-in users, usually from the frontend.
   * Here you will use a methods list.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $notLogged = ["notLogged"];

  /**
   * The capability required to execute the action.
   * Of course, this is only for logged-in users.
   *
   * @var string
   */
  protected $capability = "";

  /**
   * The nonce key used to verify the request.
   *
   * @var string
   */
  protected $nonceKey = "nonce";

  /**
   * The nonce hash used to verify the request.
   *
   * @var string
   */
  protected $nonceHash = "";

  public function trusted()
  {
    $response = "You have clicked Ajax Trusted";

    wp_send_json($response);
  }

  public function logged()
  {
    $response = "You have clicked Ajax Logged";

    wp_send_json($response);
  }

  public function notLogged()
  {
    $response = "You have clicked Ajax notLogged";

    wp_send_json($response);
  }
}
```

You can also get the post variables by using `$this->request->get('post_name')`. WordPress provides several functions to return a JSON result. For example, you may use:

```php copy
wp_send_json_succcess();
```

or

```php copy
wp_send_json_success(["hello" => "world"]);
```

In JavaScript side, you'll find:

```javascript copy
$.post(ajaxurl, {}, function (response) {
  if (response.success) {
    // success property is set by WordPress wp_send_json_success
  } else {
    // also data property is set by WordPress wp_send_json_success
    // but it contains your custom array/object
    alert(response.data.hello);
  }
});
```

<Callout type="info">
The `wp_send_json_error` function works in the same way.
</Callout>

## Security

You may protect your Ajax calls by using two main methods: by the simple capability property or by the nonce key.

### Capability

You can set the capability property in the class to protect the Ajax call. For example, if you want to allow only the `manage_options` capability, you can set the `$capability` property to `manage_options`.

### Nonce

You can set the nonce key and hash properties in the class to protect the Ajax call. To enable the nonce protection, you have to set the `$nonceHash` property with a key used to generate the nonce.

```php copy
/**
 * The nonce key used to verify the request.
 *
 * @var string
 */
protected $nonceKey = "nonce";

/**
 * The nonce hash used to verify the request.
 *
 * @var string
 */
protected $nonceHash = "anything-you-want";
```

<Callout type="info">
The `$nonceKey` property is the name of the post variable that will be sent to the server. The `$nonceHash` property is the string used to generate the nonce.
</Callout>

Next, you have to generate the nonce in your Controller and make it available to the JavaScript side. You can use the `withLocalizeScript` method to pass the nonce to the JavaScript side.

If you are using a ReactJS application, you may use something like this:

```php copy {7-8}
class DashboardController extends Controller
{
  public function index()
  {
    return WPKirk()
      ->view("dashboard.index")
      ->withLocalizeScript("app", "WPKirkNonce", [
        "nonce" => wp_create_nonce("anything-you-want"),
      ])
      ->withAdminAppsScript("app", true);
  }
}
```

The code above will create a global variable `WPKirkNonce` with the nonce value. You can use it in your ReactJS application like this:

```javascript copy
/**
 * Post data to the server.
 *
 * @param {string} action The action to be executed. Eg. "logged"
 * @returns {Promise<any>}
 */
const post = async action => {
  const res = await fetch(window.ajaxurl, {
    method: "POST",
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      action,
      nonce: WPKirkNonce.nonce,
    }),
    headers: {
      // form-data url encoded
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
  });
  return res.json();
};
```

```javascript copy
post("logged").then(response => {
  console.log(response);
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
You may use the same also in Vanilla JavaScript or any other JavaScript framework. Most probably, in WordPress you are used to jQuery, so you can use the `$.post` method.

```javascript copy
$.post(
  ajaxurl,
  {
    action: "logged",
    nonce: WPKirkNonce.nonce,
  },
  function (data) {
    alert(data);
  }
);
```
</Callout>

## Load the Ajax Service Provider

To allow Ajax calls, you need to edit the `/config/plugin.php` file. In the Ajax section, you can insert the list of your own Ajax classes, for example:

```php copy filename="/config/plugin.php"
  /*
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Ajax
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | Here is where you can register your own Ajax actions.
  |
  */

  'ajax' => [ '\WPKirk\Ajax\MyAjax' ],
```
