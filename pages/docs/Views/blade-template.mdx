# Blade Template

This document explains how to use the Blade template engine in your WP Bones plugin. Blade templates use the `.blade.php` file extension and are stored in the `resources/views` directory. It provides an example of creating a Blade view file and rendering it using the `WPKirk()->view()` method in a controller. Data can be passed to the view as a second parameter. The document also includes an example of how to use the passed data within the Blade template.

## Overview

As you may already know, the Blade template engine is used to generate HTML. The Blade template engine is a simple yet powerful templating language that is used by the Laravel framework. For more information on the Blade template engine, please visit the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/blade).

Blade template files use the `.blade.php` file extension and are typically stored in the `resources/views` directory.

## Basic Usage

The only thing you have to do to use Blade templates in your plugin is to create a view file in the `resources/views` directory. For example, you can create a file named `dashboard.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory.

You will be able to use the Blade template in the same way as you would use the current PHP template. For example, a typical controller method to render a Blade template in `resources/views/blade/demo.blade.php` would look like this:

```php copy {13}
<?php

namespace WPKirk\Http\Controllers;

use WPKirk\Http\Controllers\EloquentUser as User;

class ExampleBladeController extends Controller
{
  public function index()
  {

    return WPKirk()
      ->view('blade.demo', ['users' => User::all()])
      ->withAdminStyle('prism')
      ->withAdminScript('prism')
      ->withAdminStyle('wp-kirk-common');
  }
}
```

In the example above, we are using the `WPKirk()->view()` method to render the view. The `WPKirk()->view()` method accepts the name of the view and the data that you want to pass to the view. As you can see, it works like the `WPKirk()->view()` method of the current PHP template.

Of course, you may also pass the data to the view using the `WPKirk()->view()` method as a second parameter.

In the `resources/views/blade/demo.blade.php` file, you can use the data passed to the view like this:

```php copy
<div class="wp-kirk wrap wp-kirk-sample">

  <h1>Demo Blade</h1>

  @foreach ($users as $user)
    <p>user_nicename: {{ $user->user_nicename }}</p>
    <p>user_email: {{ $user->user_email }}</p>
  @endforeach

</div>  
```

We're using the [BladeOne](https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne) template engine. BladeOne is a standalone version of Blade Template Engine that uses a single PHP file and can be ported and used in different projects. It allows you to use Blade templates outside Laravel.
