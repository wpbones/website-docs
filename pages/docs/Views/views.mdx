# Views

This document explains how to use views in WP Bones to provide the UI and interaction with the end user. Views contain the HTML served by your plugin and are stored in the `resources/views` directory. They are usually bound with a menu and handled by a View Controller. The document provides examples of basic usage, including how to display a view and pass data to views using the `with` method, similar to Laravel.

## Overview

The views provide the UI and interaction with the end user. Usually, a view is a link in WordPress. The menus, for example, are a way to display a view.

## Basic Usage

Views contain the HTML served by your plugin and separate your controller/plugin logic from your presentation logic. Views are stored in the `resources/views` directory. A view is usually bound with a menu. So, you will handle your view from an inside method of View Controller. In the [Menus](#menus) section, we have already used a View Controller in the menu array:

```php copy
...
'route' => ['get' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@firstMenu'],
...
```

Now, let's see a simple View Controller used to display a view:

```php copy
<?php

namespace WPKirk\Http\Controllers\Dashboard;

use WPKirk\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class DashboardController extends Controller {

  public function firstMenu()
  {
    return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' );
  }
}
```

The "Dot" notation provides a simple way to organize the views. In this example, we will have the following file structure `resources/views/dashboard/index.php`. The `index.php` file is the HTML/PHP file:

```html copy
<div class="wrap">
  <h1>Hello, captain!</h1>
</div>
```

<Callout type="info">
You may use any PHP code inside the view.
</Callout>

## Passing Data To Views

As in Laravel, we can easily pass any data to the views:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] );
```

So, inside your view, you can then access the data by using its corresponding keys, such as `<?php echo $kirk; ?>`.

```html copy
<div class="wrap">
  <h1>Hello, <?php echo $kirk; ?>!</h1>
</div>
```

As an alternative to passing a complete array of data to the view, you may use the [`with()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#with) method to add individual pieces of data to the view:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )->with( 'kirk', 'Captain' );
```

In addition, you will be able to get your plugin instance by the `$plugin` variable.

<Callout type="info">
In this release, you'll find the `$plugin` variable automatically set to the plugin instance. This variable is reserved.
</Callout>

## Enqueue Styles and Scripts in Admin Area

You can enqueue all registered styles and scripts when a view is displayed. All styles and scripts files must be located in the `public/` folder. The `.css` files will be found in the `public/css/` folder, and the `.js` files will be found in the `public/js/` folder. 

Currently, you can use [`withAdminStyle()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#withadminstyle) and [`withAdminScript()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#withadminscript) to enqueue styles and scripts in the admin area.

For example:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminStyle( 'wp-kirk-common' );
```

The file `public/css/wp-kirk-common.css` will be registered and enqueued when the view is displayed.

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' );
```

The file `public/js/wp-kirk-common.js` will be registered and enqueued when the view is displayed.

Of course, you can setup both styles and scripts:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminStyle( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' );
```
Both files will be registered and enqueued when the view is displayed.

## Enqueue Style and Scripts in Theme

Also, you can enqueue scripts and styles just in the theme, for example when you will display a view for a widget. In this case, you can use [`withStyle()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#withstyle) and [`withScript()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#withscript) fluent methods. All these methods accept three parameters: name, dependencies, and version:

For Example:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withStyle( 'wp-kirk-common', [ 'wp-kirk-colors' ], '1.0' );
```

The file `public/css/wp-kirk-common.css` will be registered and enqueued when the view is displayed.

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withScript( 'wp-kirk-common', [ 'wp-kirk-colors' ], '1.0' );
```

The file `public/js/wp-kirk-common.js` will be registered and enqueued when the view is displayed.

Of course, you can setup both styles and scripts:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withStyle( 'wp-kirk-common', [ 'wp-kirk-colors' ], '1.0' )
               ->withScript( 'wp-kirk-common', [ 'wp-kirk-colors' ], '1.0' );
```
Both files will be registered and enqueued when the view is displayed.

## Inline Style and Scripts

You may add inline style to your view by using the [`withInlineStyle()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#withinlinestyle) method. 

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->withAdminStyle( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withInlineStyle('wp-kirk-common', 'body { background-color: #f00; }');
```

You may add inline scripts to your view by using the [`withInlineScript()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#withinlinescript) method. 

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withInlineScript('wp-kirk-common', 'console.log("Hello, Captain!");');
```

or

```php copy
$myData = [
  'name' => 'Captain',
  'rank' => 'Captain'
];

return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withInlineScript('wp-kirk-common', 'const kirk = ' . json_encode( $myData ) . ';');
```
You may use the inline script to pass the Ajax URL and any nonce values from PHP to JavaScript.

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withInlineScript('wp-kirk-common', 'const ajaxUrl = "' . admin_url('admin-ajax.php') . '";');
```

Ajax URL and nonce values are very common in WordPress development. You can use the inline script to pass these values to your JavaScript.

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withInlineScript('wp-kirk-common', 'const ajaxUrl = "' . admin_url('admin-ajax.php') . '"; const nonce = "' . wp_create_nonce('wp-kirk-nonce') . '";');
```
In these cases you may use a global variable to access the values in your scripts.

```php copy
$globalData = [
  'ajaxUrl' => admin_url('admin-ajax.php'),
  'nonce' => wp_create_nonce('wp-kirk-nonce')
];

$globalObject = 'wpKirkGlobal';

return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withInlineScript('wp-kirk-common', 'const ' . $globalObject . ' = ' . json_encode( $globalData ) . ';');
```

```javascript copy
(function($) {
  'use strict';
  
  // Post data to the server
  $.ajax({
    url: wpKirkGlobal.ajaxUrl,
    type: 'POST',
    data: {
      action: 'wp_kirk_action',
      nonce: wpKirkGlobal.nonce
    },
    success: function(response) {
      console.log(response);
    }
  });
})(jQuery);
```

## Localize Scripts

You may localize your scripts by using the [`withLocalizeScript()`](/docs/CoreClasses/view#withlocalizescript) method. For example:

```php copy
$localization_data = array(
    'greeting' => __('Hello, World!', 'wp-kirk'),
    'farewell' => __('Goodbye, World!', 'wp-kirk'),
    'ajax_url' => admin_url('admin-ajax.php'),
);

return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withLocalizeScript('wp-kirk-common', 'wpKirkGlobal', $localization_data);
```
As you know, you will be able to access the `wpKirkGlobal` variable in your scripts. For example:

```javascript copy filename="wp-kirk-common.js"
(function($) {
  'use strict';
  
  alert(wpKirkGlobal.greeting);

})(jQuery);
```

## Fragment

A very useful feature of View is the ability to include another View. For example, you could use the following:

```html copy
<h1>
  Main view in file "/views/main.php"
</h1>
<?php echo WPKirk()->view( 'fragment' ) ?>
```

In the above example, we are going to load the `/view/fragment.php` view into the main view. This feature is very useful for loops or dynamic parts of a view. Let's show a more complete example:

```html copy
<!-- this main view: echo WPKirk()->view( 'main' )->with( 'items', $items ) -->
<h1>
  Main view in file "/views/main.php"
</h1>
<?php echo WPKirk()->view( 'list-items' ) ?>
```

In the `/views/list-items.php` you will find:

```html copy
<ul>
<?php foreach( $items as $item ) : ?>
  <li><?php echo $item ?></li>
<?php endforach; ?>
</ul>
```

<Callout type="info">
Of course, if you have used a folder for your views, you will have to add it to the fragment.
</Callout>

```html copy
<h1>
  Main view in file "/views/dasboard/index.php"
</h1>
<?php echo WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.list-items' ) ?>
```

## Content

Of course, you may get the content of a view and use it in several ways. For example, to send an email.

```php copy
$content = WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.list-items' )
                   ->toHTML();
```
or

```php copy
$content = WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.list-items' )
                   ->render( true );
```

## Ajax

You may wish to return a view or a fragment of a view as a JSON return. In this case, you can use:

```php copy
wp_send_json_success(
  [
    'feedback' => WPKirk()->view( 'tools.index' )->render()
  ]
);
```
The `render` method will verify if the call is by Ajax and it will return the processed HTML.
