# ReactJS Applications Localization

---
<DocsBoilerplateDemo slug="internationalization" />

## Overview

Before you start, make sure you have installed [WP-CLI](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/).
That's because you will need to use the new npm scripts for the localization.

<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸ›‘">
If you want to localize your ReactJS application, you won't be able to use the `lazy` import. That's because the wp-script will generate several files, for example `437.js`, which won't be able to be localized.
</Callout>

## Typical Workflow

Below a typical workflow to localize your ReactJS application:

<Steps>
### Use the `@wordpress/i18n`

First of all, you need to use the [`@wordpress/i18n`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-i18n/) package to localize your ReactJS application.

```jsx copy
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n'
```

In your ReactJS application, you can use the `__` function to localize your strings.

```jsx copy
import { __ } from '@wordpress/i18n'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {__('Hello World', 'my-text-domain')}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Build your ReactJS application

After you have localized your ReactJS application, you can build it using the following command:

```bash copy
npm run build
```
In the `public/apps` folder, you will find the build files.

### Generate the .pot file

To generate the `.pot` file, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
npm run make-pot
```

### Edit the `.pot` file

After you have generated the `.pot` file, you can edit it to add the translations.

Here are a few tools that can be used to translate PO files online:

- [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)
- [WebTranslateIt](https://webtranslateit.com/en)
- [Poeditor](https://poeditor.com/)
- [Google Translator Toolkit](http://translate.google.com/toolkit/)
- [GlotPress](http://blog.glotpress.org/)

And follow the [steps](/docs/Internationalization/php-localization#how-to-translate-the-pot-file) to translate the strings.

### Generate the `.json` file

To generate the `.json` file, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
npm run make-json
```

### Load the translations

To load the translations, you can use

```php copy
<?php

namespace WPKirk\Http\Controllers;

class WPKirkController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return WPKirk()
            ->view('analytics.index')
            ->withAdminAppsScript('analytics/analytics', true);
    }
}
```

</Steps>
