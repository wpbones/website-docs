# Internationalization

---
<DocsBoilerplateDemo slug="internationalization" />

Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing and developing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization (l10n) is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.

You will find more information about the internationalization process in the [WordPress Codex](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/internationalization/).

## Overview

WP Bones already supports the internationalization process for the PHP code. 
You can find the `.pot` file in the `languages` folder in our [WPBones demo plugin](https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk) and [WPBones Boilerplate plugin](https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk-Boilerplate).

<Callout type="info">
Previously the `.pot` file was in the `localization` folder. Starting from WP Bones `1.6.0` we have renamed the folder to `languages`.
Anyway, you can still change the folder name used for the translations in the main plugin file by using the `Domain Path` header.
```php copy filename="your-plugin.php" {15}
<?php

/**
 * Plugin Name: WP Kirk
 * Plugin URI: https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk
 * Description: WP Bones template WordPress plugin
 * Version: 1.6.0
 * Requires at least: 6.2
 * Requires PHP: 7.4
 * Author: Giovambattista Fazioli
 * Author URI: https://wpbones.com/
 * License: GPLv2 or later
 * License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

 */
```
</Callout>
    
Under the hood WP bones uses the `load_plugin_textdomain()` function to load the translations.

Starting from WP Bones `1.6.0` you will be able to use the internationalization process to translate the React components and the Blocks. The plugin uses the [`make-pot`](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/i18n/make-pot/) and [`make-json`](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/i18n/make-json/) scripts to generate the `.pot` and `.json` files.

## Useful additional tools

You can also use a text editor to enter the translation. In a text editor the strings will look like this.

```
#: plugin-name.php:123 
msgid "Page Title" 
msgstr ""
```
Here are a few tools that can be used to translate PO files online:

- [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)
- [WebTranslateIt](https://webtranslateit.com/en)
- [Poeditor](https://poeditor.com/)
- [Google Translator Toolkit](http://translate.google.com/toolkit/)
- [GlotPress](http://blog.glotpress.org/)
