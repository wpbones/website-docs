# Javascript Localization

WordPress provides the [`wp_localize_script()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_localize_script/) function to pass data from PHP to JavaScript. This function is used to pass the localized strings to the JavaScript file.

<Callout type="info">
More generally, the function [`wp_localize_script()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_localize_script/) is used to add a global JavaScript object with data. This function is often used to pass any type of data to JavaScript, not just localized strings. Today, it is possible to use [`wp_add_inline_script()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_add_inline_script/) to pass data to JavaScript. Our suggestion is to use [`wp_localize_script()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_localize_script/) only for passing localized strings.

So you should follow the same rule in WP Bones and use the fluent method `withLocalizeScript()` to pass the localized strings to the JavaScript file. And use the fluent `withInlineScript()` method to pass any other type of data to the JavaScript file.

In WP Bones you can use the fluent `withLocalizeScript()` method to pass the localized strings to the JavaScript file.

Here is an example of how to pass the localized strings to the JavaScript file:

```php copy filename="Your Controller"
$localization_data = array(
    'greeting' => __('Hello, World!', 'wp-kirk'),
    'farewell' => __('Goodbye, World!', 'wp-kirk'),
    'ajax_url' => admin_url('admin-ajax.php'),
);

return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withLocalizeScript('wp-kirk-common', 'wpKirkGlobal', $localization_data);
```

```javascript copy filename="wp-kirk-common.js"
(function($) {
  'use strict';
  
  alert(wpKirkGlobal.greeting);

})(jQuery);
```
