# Seeding

<BoilerplateDemoButton slug="database" />

## Overview

Similarly to Laravel, WP Bones includes the ability to seed your database with data using seed classes. All seed classes are stored in the `database/seeders` directory.
The seeder classes will be loaded and executed when the plugin is activated.

## Writing Seeders

A seeder class only contains one method by default: `run`. You have to define the table name as well.
Below is an example of a seeder class used in the [wpbones/geolocalizer](https://packagist.org/packages/wpbones/geolocalizer) package.

<Callout type="info">
Currently, there is no way to write seeders using `php bones`. We are working on that.
</Callout>


```php copy
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "countries";

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
      // for example, here we are going to truncate the table
      $this->truncate();

      // and then we are going to insert some data
      $this->insert(
      "(id, zone, country, isocode, currency, symbol, symbol_html, code, tax, continent, status)
      VALUES
      	(1,'','Mauritania','MR','Mauritanian Ouguiya','','','MRO',0.00,'africa','publish')");
  }
}
```

Currently, the seeder is executed when the plugin is activated. If you want to execute the seeder just one time, you can set the `runOnce` property to `true`.

```php copy
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "my_plugin_products";

  // Run the database seeds just once
  protected $runOnce = true;

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
      // since the seeder is executed only one time, we can remove the truncate method
      //$this->truncate();

      // and then we are going to insert some data
      $this->insert(
      "(id, zone, country, isocode, currency, symbol, symbol_html, code, tax, continent, status)
      VALUES
      	(1,'','Mauritania','MR','Mauritanian Ouguiya','','','MRO',0.00,'africa','publish')");
  }
}
```

## WordPress prefix

As you know, the real name of the table `my_plugin_products` is `{prefix}_my_plugin_products`. Usually, `{prefix}` is `wp_` for default. Anyway, you don't need to use the WordPress prefix, WP Bones will do that for you.

### Remove the WordPress prefix

Starting from version `1.7.0`, you can remove the WordPress prefix. You may use the `usePrefix` property in the migration class:

```php copy {18}
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "my_plugin_products";

  // Run the database seeds just once
  protected $runOnce = true;

  // Remove the WordPress prefix
  protected $usePrefix = false;

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
      // since the seeder is executed only one time, we can remove the truncate method
      //$this->truncate();

      // and then we are going to insert some data
      $this->insert(
      "(id, zone, country, isocode, currency, symbol, symbol_html, code, tax, continent, status)
      VALUES
      	(1,'','Mauritania','MR','Mauritanian Ouguiya','','','MRO',0.00,'africa','publish')");
  }
}
```

In this case the table name will be `my_plugin_products`.

## Use a model

You can use a model to seed your database.

```php copy
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to use your model
use WPKirk\Models\MyPluginProducts;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "my_plugin_products";

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
    // insert by using the model class
    MyPluginProducts::insert([
        ['name' => 'iMac', 'price' => '100000'],
        ['name' => 'iPhone', 'price' => '20000'],
        ['name' => 'iPad', 'price' => '30000'],
        ['name' => 'iPod', 'price' => '10000'],
      ]
    );
  }
}
```
### Remove the WordPress prefix

If you want to remove the WordPress prefix, and you are using a model, you have to set the `usePrefix` property to `false` in the seeder class.

```php copy {18} filename="The seeder"
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to use your model
use WPKirk\Models\MyPluginBooks;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "my_plugin_books";

  // Remove the WordPress prefix
  protected $usePrefix = false;

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
    // insert by using the model class
    MyPluginBooks::insert([
        ['name' => 'iMac', 'price' => '100000'],
        ['name' => 'iPhone', 'price' => '20000'],
        ['name' => 'iPad', 'price' => '30000'],
        ['name' => 'iPod', 'price' => '10000'],
      ]
    );
  }
}
```

In the Model class, you have to set to false the second parameter of the `DB::getTableName` method.

```php copy {21} filename="The model"
<?php
namespace WPKirk\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

class EloquentBook extends Model
{
  /**
   * Disable Illuminate timestamp columns.
   *
   * @var bool
   */
  public $timestamps = false;

  /**
   * Get the table associated with the model.
   */
  public function getTable(): string
  {
    return DB::getTableName('MyPluginBooks', false);
  }
}
```
