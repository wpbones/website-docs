# Pages Routing

<DocsBoilerplateDemo slug="routes" />

In addition to [Menus Routing](menus-routing), you may add a page routing without creating a menu. 

In the `config/routes.php` you'll find an array with the page routing settings:

```php copy filename="config/routes.php"
<?php
if (!defined('ABSPATH')) {
    exit();
}

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Custom page routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here is where you can register all page routes for your custom view.
| Then you will use $plugin->getPageUrl( 'custom_page' ) to get the URL.
|
*/

return [

  'custom_page' => [
    'title'      => 'Title of page',
    'capability' => 'read',
    'route'      => [
      'get' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@customPage'
    ]
  ]

];
```

As you can see, a page route is very similar to a menu. Also, the `route` key works like the `route` menu. You can get the URL of a page by using `$plugin->getPageUrl` method. For example, to get the URL of the above custom page, please use:

```php copy
$url = $plugin->getPageUrl( 'custom_page');
// you'll get something like
// http://domain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=custom_page
```

## Custom Admin Pages folder

You may also create a custom page by creating a file in the folder `pages`.
Let's say you want to create a custom page called `custom_page`. You have to create a file called `custom_page.php` in the `pages` folder.

```php copy
<?php

use WPKirk\WPBones\Routing\Pages\Support\Page;

class CustomPage extends Page
{
    public function title()
    {
        return "Hello, Custom Page!";
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return $this->plugin->view('dashboard.custom_page');
    }
}
```

<Callout >
The class name is not important. You can use any name you want. The most important thing is the name of the file. In this case, the file name is `custom_page.php`. This means that the slug of the page will be `custom_page`.
</Callout>

You will be able to get the URL of the custom page by using `$plugin->getPageUrl` method. For example, to get the URL of the above custom page, please use:

```php copy
<?php $plugin->getPageUrl('custom_page'); ?>
```
