# Menus Routing

---
<DocsBoilerplateDemo slug="routes" />

In WordPress as well as WP Bones architecture, the routing is quite different from Laravel. Instead of a true routing system, there is menu routing. However, you can still handle basic HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. In the example above, we used the `get` verb in the `route` key. If your view contains a form with a POST method, you can use:

```php copy
...
  'route' => [
    'get'  => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@secondMenu',
    'post' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@updateValues'
  ]
...  
```

In this case, when an HTTP POST request is made, the method `updateValues` in `Dashboard\DashboardController` will be called.

## Form Method Spoofing

HTML forms do not support `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` actions. So, when defining `PUT`, `PATCH` or`DELETE` routes that are called from an HTML form, you will need to add a hidden `_method` field to the form. The value sent with the `_method` field will be used in the HTTP request:

```html copy
<form action="" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">
</form>
```

## Resource

Alternatively, instead of specifying each single HTTP verb, you may use the `resource` key in order to call the default method in your view controller:

```php copy
...
  'route' => [ 'resource' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController' ],
...
```

Once you have assigned the view controller to a given route resource, you may use the standard methods instead.

```php copy
class DashboardResourceController extends Controller {
  
  // GET
  public function index() {
    //
  }
  
  // POST
  public function store() {
    //
  }
  
  // PUT AND PATCH
  public function update() {
    //
  }

  // DELETE
  public function destroy() {
    //
  }
}
```

You can use the `php bones` command to create a controller:

```sh copy
php bones make:controller MyController
```

Create the folder and namespace

```sh copy
php bones make:controller Billing/Market/MyController
```

## Redirect in load

When a submenu is clicked, your controller's methods are executed inside the admin view. This means that the HTTP headers are already sent. So, you can't execute any HTTP redirect but only a script - workaround - redirect. Anyway, WP Bones provides a redirect method that you may use. If the headers are already sent, a JavaScript script redirect will be done:

```php copy
// POST
public function store() {
  // your store command
  $this->redirect( 'some url' );
}
```

Also, WP Bones provides a special route called `load`. It is executed before the page is rendered:

```php copy
...
  'route' => [ 'load' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@load' ],
...
```

<Callout>
You will need to use this method to add meta boxes.
</Callout>



```php copy
public function load()
{
    wp_enqueue_script( 'common' );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'wp-lists' );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'postbox' );
    
    // TODO: add your meta boxes
}
```

This route will be called on the `load-{hook}` action. Here you can use `wp_redirect()` or the WP Bones redirect method. Let's see an example:

```html copy
<form action="" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="_redirect" value="http://undolog.com">
  <button class="button">POST with redirect</button>
</form>
```

In the `load` method of the controller:

```php copy
public function load()
{
  if( $this->request->get( '_redirect' ) ) {
    // the wp_redirect() will be done
    $this->redirect( $this->request->get( '_redirect' ) );
  }
}
```
