# Hooks and Modules

This document explains the use of `hooks` and `modules` folders in WP Bones starting from version 1.8. The `hooks` folder is for files that are automatically loaded when the plugin starts, containing hooks, filters, shortcodes, etc. The `modules` folder is also introduced for further flexibility. Examples are provided for basic and advanced usage, demonstrating how to create and use PHP files within these folders to define custom hooks and actions.

## Overview

To further enhance the flexibility of including external files, starting from  <Badge size="lg" component="span">version 1.8</Badge>, WP Bones allows the creation of two optional folders within the `plugin` folder. These folders are `hooks` and `modules`.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my_plugin" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="plugin" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="hooks" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="modules" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Hooks

The `hooks` folder is intended to hold all the files that we want to be automatically loaded when the plugin starts. These files can contain hooks, filters, shortcodes, etc. Essentially, anything.

### Basic usage

To use the `hooks` folder, you may create one or more PHP files. For example, you can create a file named `my-hooks.php` and add the following code:

```php copy filename="plugin/hooks/my-hooks.php"
<?php

/**
 * You may use this file to define your own hooks.
 * This file, and any other file in this directory, will be automatically included in the plugin.
 */

function my_hooks()
{
  echo "Hello, World!";
}
```

Now the function `my_hooks()` will be available throughout the plugin.

### Advanced usage

You can also use the `hooks` folder to create a file for each hook. For example, you can create a file named `my-action.php` and add the following code:

```php copy filename="plugin/hooks/my-action.php"
<?php

/**
 * You may use this file to define your own hooks.
 * This file, and any other file in this directory, will be automatically included in the plugin.
 */

add_action('wp_head', 'my_action');

function my_action()
{
  echo "Hello, World!";
}
```

### Goodies

If you're a React developer and love ❤️ hooks, you can also approach PHP programming with the same concept. For example, you can create a file named `use-option.php` and add the following code:

```php copy filename="plugin/hooks/use-option.php"
<?php

function useOption($name, $default = '')
{
  $value = get_option($name, $default);

  return [$value, function ($v) use ($name) {
    update_option($name, $v);
    return $v;
  }];
}
```
To use this hook in this way:

```php copy
list($value, $setValue) = useOption('my_option', 'default value');
```
or even better

```php copy
[$value, $setValue] = useOption('my_option', 'default value');

echo $value; // default value
$value = $setValue('new value');
```
## Modules

Modules are similar to hooks, but unlike hooks, they must be explicitly loaded. Modules are also PHP files and must be located within the folder: `/plugin/modules/`.

To load a module, you can use the `wpbones_module()` function. For example, you can create a file named `my-module.php` and add the following code:

```php copy filename="plugin/modules/my-module.php"
<?php

function my_simple_function()
{
  echo "Hello, I'm a simple function!";
}
```

and then load it using:

```php copy
// NOTE that you don't need to use the .php extension or the path
wpbones_module('my-module');

my_simple_function(); // Hello, I'm a simple function!
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
> WP Bones also provides the `import` function to load modules. Since this might be a common function, it is generally better to use `wpbones_module()`. However, if you wish to use `import`, you can do so.
```php copy
// NOTE that you don't need to use the .php extension or the path
import('my-module');
my_simple_function(); // Hello, I'm a simple function!
```
</Callout>

### Advanced use case

The modules can also be used for more interesting and advanced cases like the following.

For example, you can create in the `/plugin/modules/my-awesome-function.php`

```php copy filename="plugin/modules/my-awesome-function.php"
<?php

return function () {
  echo "Hello, I'm an awesome function!";
};
```
and then load it using:

```php copy
$awesome_function = wpbones_module('my-awesome-function');
$awesome_function(); // Hello, I'm an awesome function!
```

### Goodies

Another example is to create a module that returns an array. For example, you can create in the `/plugin/modules/config.php`

```php copy filename="plugin/modules/config.php"
<?php

return [
  'controller' => 'WPKirk\Http\Controllers\Examples\ExampleController',
  'mul' => function ($a, $b) {
    return $a * $b;
  }
];
```
and then load it using:

```php copy
$config = wpbones_module('config');
echo $config['controller']; // WPKirk\Http\Controllers\Examples\ExampleController
echo $config['mul'](2, 3); // 6
```
you may also use a different syntax:

```php copy
['controller' => $controller, 'mul' => $mul] = wpbones_module('config');
echo $controller; // WPKirk\Http\Controllers\Examples\ExampleController
echo $mul(2, 3); // 6
```

Of course, you may return any type of data from a module, not just an array. For example, you can return a string, an object, or even a function. For example, you may return an instance of a class:

```php copy filename="plugin/modules/my-class.php"
<?php

class MyClass
{
  public function __construct()
  {
    echo "Hello, I'm a class!";
  }

  public function myMethod()
  {
    echo "Hello, I'm a method!";
  }
}

return new MyClass();
```

and then load it using:

```php copy
$my_class = wpbones_module('my-class');
// Hello, I'm a class!
$my_class->myMethod(); // Hello, I'm a method!
```
