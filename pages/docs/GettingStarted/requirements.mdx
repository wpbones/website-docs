# Requirements

WP Bones has a few system requirements. However, if you are a newbie in [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), please, visit the related website before continuing.

- PHP >= 7.4+
- git
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/#installing)

<Callout type="info">
The WP-CLI is not mandatory but it is very useful. Anyway, if you want to run the scripts `make-pot` and `make-json` used to translate the plugin, you need to install it.

## WordPress environment

The `php bones` command should be run from your WordPress environment (in the [Vagrant](https://github.com/gfazioli/VagrantUbuntu) or [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet) environment) because it will load WordPress. Also, make sure to install `git` and `composer` in your WordPress environment. In your host machine (Mac or PC), you can install `npm`. It is used only by `gulp`.
