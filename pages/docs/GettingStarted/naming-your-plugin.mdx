# Naming Your Plugin

This document explains how to rename your plugin using WP Bones with the command `php bones rename <your plugin name> <your namespace>`. It updates the plugin name, namespace, slug, variables, internal ID, and main plugin file. Use double quotes for arguments with spaces on Windows. If no name is provided, you'll be prompted to enter one. The namespace can be auto-generated from the plugin name. The main plugin file name replaces `index.php` to comply with WordPress repository requirements.

## Bones "artisan" command

When you install **your plugin**, you may wish to change the plugin name. This is a common practice when you are using **bones** as a starting point for your plugin development.

Let's rename the plugin name and the namespace:

```shell copy
php bones rename <your plugin name> <your namespace>
```

<Callout type="info">
Note: On Windows, the command line treats single quotes differently than double quotes. To ensure compatibility, always use double quotes for arguments containing spaces.
</Callout>

If you leave blank `<your plugin name>`, a command line prompt will be displayed, and you will be asked to enter a new Plugin name. The Bones command will use this information to make some changes to the code. Also, the **bones** command will use it as a namespace as well as a slug. 

<Callout type="info">
The plugin name is the first argument and you can skip the second argument if you want to use the namespace generated by the plugin name.
</Callout>


For example, if you enter `"My WP Plugin"`, the bones command will create:

```
My WP Plugin          Name of plugin
MyWPPlugin            Namespace, see [PSR-4 autoloading standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)
my_wp_plugin_slug     Plugin slug
my_wp_plugin_vars     Plugin vars used for CPT, taxonomy, etc.
my-wp-plugin          Internal id used for css, js and less files
my-wp-plugin.php      Main plugin file
```

<Callout type="info">
Starting from `v1.5.0`, we replaced the previous `index.php` main plugin file with the name of your plugin. This change was made to avoid rejection from the WordPress plugin repository.
</Callout>

## Naming Your Plugin Again

After installing **your plugin**, you may wish to change the plugin name again.

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
Remember that a plugin name is bound to PHP namespace. This is because WordPress doesn't support namespaces in the current plugin architecture.
</Callout>


You can do this by using the `rename` command in the Bones command line:

```shell copy
php bones rename "WP My Awesome Plugin"
```

In this case, you will get:

```
WP My Awesome Plugin          Name of plugin
WPMyAwesomePlugin             Namespace (PSR-4)
wp_my_awesome_plugin_slug     Plugin slug
wp_my_awesome_plugin_vars     Plugin vars used for CPT, taxonomy, etc.
wp-my-awesome_plugin          Internal id used for css, js and less files
wp-my-awesome-plugin.php      Main plugin file
```

## Options

You may also reset the plugin name and the namespace to the original version.

```shell copy
php bones rename --reset
```

In addition to that, you may also update the namespace after a composer update.

```shell copy
php bones rename --update
```

<Callout type="info">
Probably, you won't need to do that as the update flow is already in the composer file
</Callout>


```json copy
...
  "scripts": {
    "post-autoload-dump": [
      "php -r \"copy('vendor/wpbones/wpbones/src/Console/bin/bones', 'bones');\"",
      "php bones rename --update"
    ]
  }
  ...
```
