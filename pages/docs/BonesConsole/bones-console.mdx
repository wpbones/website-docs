# Bones Command-Line Interface

Bones is also the name of the command-line interface included with all our [WP Bones Boilerplate](/docs/GettingStarted/boilerplate-templates). It provides a number of helpful commands for your use while developing your plugin. You will use the Bones command-line interface to start your development. First of all, try the command-line console by running:

```ansi 
[38;5;76m>[0m php bones
```
![WP Bones CLI](../GettingStarted/php-bones-console.png)

Then, you can change the plugin namespace from `WPKirk` to `My First WP Bones Plugin`, for example:

```sh copy
php bones rename "My First WP Bones Plugin"
```
<Callout type="info" emoji={<IconBrandWindows />}>
Note: On Windows, the command line treats single quotes differently than double quotes. To ensure compatibility, always use double quotes for arguments containing spaces.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
As you can see from the above command, the plugin name is enclosed in double quotes. This is because the plugin name contains spaces. If the plugin name does not contain spaces, you can omit the double quotes. Moreover, the plugin name is the first argument and you can skip the second argument if you want to use the namespace generated by the plugin name.
</Callout>

Great! You are quite ready to start developing.

## Common Commands

### `deploy`

When your plugin is ready, you can use the `deploy` bones command in order to create a new folder useful to submit your plugin to the wordpress.org repository.

```sh copy
php bones deploy your-path/mydeploy
```

Remeber that you can ask for help by using:

```sh copy
php bones deploy --help
```

```sh copy
Usage:
  deploy <path>

Arguments:
  path		The complete path of deploy.
  [--wp]	You are going to release this plugin in the WordPress.org public repository.
```
The `--wp` option will create a deploy folder with the necessary files to submit your plugin to the WordPress repository. For further information, see [here](../GettingStarted/before-submit-to-wordpress-repository).

#### `--wp`

<Callout type="info" emoji={<IconBrandWordpress />}>
Starting from WP Bones `v1.5.0` we added a new option `--wp` to deploy the plugin to the WordPress repository. This option will create a deploy folder with the necessary files to submit your plugin to the WordPress repository. For further information, see [here](../GettingStarted/before-submit-to-wordpress-repository).
</Callout>

In the `mydeploy` folder, you will find only the necessary files to run your plugin. 
Without the `--wp` option the developer's `resources/assets` folder will be removed.

### Customize Deploy

Of course, you may customize the deployment process by editing the `deploy.php` file. In this file, you can add your own commands to run before and after the deployment. You will also find some actions and filters to customize the deployment process.

For example, you can add any custom command to run before the deployment by using:

```php copy
/**
* Fired when the deploy command is started
*
* @param object $console Instance of WPBones Console
* @param string $path Destination path
*/
add_action('wpbones_console_deploy_start', function ($console, $path) {
    // Do something
}, 10, 2);
```

Or change the list of skipped files by using:

```php copy
/**
* Filter the list of the folder to skip for the deploy version
*
* @param array $folders List of folders to skip
* @return array List of folders to skip
*/
add_filter('wpbones_console_deploy_skip_folders', function ($folders) {
    return $folders;
});
```

### `install`

The `install` command is used to install the WP Bones framework. You can use the `install` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones install
```

â†’ See more about [Installing WP Bones](../GettingStarted/installation).

### `optimize`

The `optimize` command uses the `composer dump-autoload -o` command to optimize the autoloader. You can use the `optimize` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones optimize
```

### `rename`

The `rename` command is used to rename the plugin namespace. You can use the `rename` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones rename "My First WP Bones Plugin"
```

â†’ See more about [Naming your Plugin](../GettingStarted/naming-your-plugin).

### `require`

The `require` command is used to install third-party packages. You can use the `require` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones require <PackageName>
```

Under the hood the `require` command uses the `composer require` command. But it also renames the package name in the `composer.json` file.

We recommend using this command instead of `composer require` because by doing so, an automatic renaming will be performed.

### `tinker`

The `tinker` command is used to open an interactive shell. You can use the `tinker` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones tinker
```

Now you can run any PHP code

```sh copy
>>> echo "Hello"
Hello
```

You can also use any WordPress function

```sh copy
>>> echo get_bloginfo('version');
6.6.2
```

### `update`

The `update` command is used to update the WP Bones framework. You can use the `update` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones update
```

â†’ After updating the WP Bones framework, have a look at the [Changelog](../release-notes) to see what's new.<br/>
â†’ And you may also check the [Core Plugin Files](../CorePluginFiles/overview) to see if there are any changes.

### `version`

The `version` command is used to version your plugin. You can use the `version` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones version 1.0.0
```

The above command will update the plugin version in the main plugin file and in the `readme.txt` file.

<Callout type="info">
Despite PHP Bones supporting semantic versioning, we suggest you use the same version in the `readme.txt` file and in the main plugin file. In short, avoid using the `v` prefix in the version number.
</Callout>

You can see the help by using:

```sh copy
php bones version --help
```

```sh copy
readme.txt > 1.4.0 (Stable tag: 1.4.0)
wp-kirk.php  > 1.4.0 ( * Version: 1.4.0)

Usage:
  version [plugin version]

Arguments:
  [plugin version]		    The version of plugin. Examples: '2.0',  'v1.2',  '1.2.0-rc.40', 'v1-beta.4'
  [--major]			        Increment the <major>.y.z of plugin.
  [--minor]			        Increment the x.<minor>.z of plugin.
  [--patch]			        Increment the x.y.<patch> of plugin.
  [--pre-patch] <prefix>	Increment the x.y.<patch>-<prefix>.<i> of plugin.
  [--pre-minor] <prefix>	Increment the x.<minor>.z-<prefix>.<i> of plugin.
  [--pre-major] <prefix>	Increment the <major>.y.z-<prefix>.<i> of plugin.
```

The `php bones version` command can handle the version starting from the current version of the plugin. You can use the following options:

#### `--major`

Increments the major version number. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `2.0.0`.

#### `--minor`

Increment the minor version number. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `1.1.0`.

#### `--patch`

Increment the patch version number. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `1.0.1`.

You can also use the `--pre-patch`, `--pre-minor`, and `--pre-major` options to increment the version with a prefix. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `1.0.1-rc.1`.

The default prefix is `rc`. But you can change it by using: 

```sh copy
php bones version 1.0.0 --pre-patch beta
```

The above command will update the plugin version to `1.0.1-beta.1`.

### `plugin`

The `plugin` command is used to get and check your plugin. You can use the `plugin` command by running:

```sh copy
php bones plugin
```
You will see the current header of your main plugin file.

```txt copy

```sh copy
php bones make:cpt MyCustomPostTypeClass
```
