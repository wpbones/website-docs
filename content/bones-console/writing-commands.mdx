# Writing Commands

This document explains how to write custom commands in WP Bones. Commands are typically stored in the `plugin/Console/Commands` directory. To create a new command, use the `php bones make:console MyCommand` command, which generates a new command class. The document provides an example of a generated command class and explains the structure, including setting the signature and description properties and implementing the `handle` method. It also covers adding the command class to the `plugin/Console/Commands/Kernel.php` file.

## Overview

In addition to the commands provided within Bones, you may also build your own custom commands.
Commands are typically stored in the `plugin/Console/Commands` directory; however, you are free to choose your own storage location as long as your commands can be loaded by Composer.

## Generating Commands

To create a new command, use the `make:console` Bones command.
This command will create a new command class in the `plugin/Console/Commands` directory.
Don't worry if this directory does not exist in your plugin, since it will be created the very first time when running the `make:command` Bones command.
The generated command will include the default set of properties and methods that are present on all commands:

```sh copy
php bones make:console MyCommand
```

The above command will generate a class at `plugin/Console/Commands/MyCommand.php`. It will generate the file `plugin/Console/Kernel.php` if it doesn't exist. The signature of the command and the command name will be asked in the console.

```php filename="plugin/Console/Commands/MyCommand.php" copy
<?php
namespace WPKirk\Console\Commands;

use WPKirk\WPBones\Console\Command;

class MyCommand extends Command
{

  protected $signature = 'wpkirk:sample {--name= : Display your name}';

  protected $description = 'Example of bones command';

  public function handle()
  {
    if( $this->options( 'name' ) ) {
      $this->line( 'Hello, ' . $this->options( 'name' ) );
    } else {
      $this->line( 'Hello, World!' );
    }
  }
}
```

### Call a command
To run a command, you must call it from `php bones`, not from `wp cli`, i.e.:
```
php bones wpkirk:sample --name "your name"
```

## Command Structure

Once your command is generated, you should fill out the signature and description properties of the class, which will be used when displaying your command on the list screen.

The `handle` method will be called when your command is executed. You may place any command logic in this method.

You will also need to add the command class in the `plugin/Console/Commands/Kernel.php` file, in the `$command` property array.

```php copy
<?php
namespace WPKirk\Console;

use WPKirk\WPBones\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
  protected $commands = [
    'WPKirk\Console\Commands\MyCommand',
  ];
}
```

## Customizing Deploy

You can customize the deployment process by using the action `wpbones_console_deploy_completed`. This is very useful, for example, to delete a folder and write a new file. To do that, you can override the `__construct` method in your command.

```php copy
public function __construct()
{
    parent::__construct();

    /**
     * Fired when the deploy command is completed
     *
     * @param object $console Instance of WPBones Console
     * @param string $path Destination path
     */
    add_action('wpbones_console_deploy_completed',
        function ($console, $path) {
            $console->deleteDirectory("{$path}/my-folder");
        }, 10, 2);
}
```

You will find more actions and filters in the `deploy.php` file in the root of your Bones plugin.
That's another way to [customize the deploy process](bones-console#customize-deploy).
