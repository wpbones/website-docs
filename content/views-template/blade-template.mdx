# Blade Template

This document explains how to use the Blade template engine in your WP Bones plugin. Blade templates use the `.blade.php` file extension and are stored in the `resources/views` directory. It provides an example of creating a Blade view file and rendering it using the `WPKirk()->view()` method in a controller. Data can be passed to the view as a second parameter. The document also includes an example of how to use the passed data within the Blade template.

## Overview

As you may already know, the Blade template engine is used to generate HTML. The Blade template engine is a simple yet powerful templating language that is used by the Laravel framework. For more information on the Blade template engine, please visit the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/blade).

Blade template files use the `.blade.php` file extension and are typically stored in the `resources/views` directory.

## Basic Usage

The only thing you have to do to use Blade templates in your plugin is to create a view file in the `resources/views` directory. For example, you can create a file named `dashboard.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory.

You will be able to use the Blade template in the same way as you would use the current PHP template. For example, a typical controller method to render a Blade template in `resources/views/blade/demo.blade.php` would look like this:

```php copy {13}
<?php

namespace WPKirk\Http\Controllers;

use WPKirk\Http\Controllers\EloquentUser as User;

class ExampleBladeController extends Controller
{
  public function index()
  {

    return WPKirk()
      ->view('blade.demo', ['users' => User::all()])
      ->withAdminStyle('prism')
      ->withAdminScript('prism')
      ->withAdminStyle('wp-kirk-common');
  }
}
```

In the example above, we are using the `WPKirk()->view()` method to render the view. The `WPKirk()->view()` method accepts the name of the view and the data that you want to pass to the view. As you can see, it works like the `WPKirk()->view()` method of the current PHP template.

Of course, you may also pass the data to the view using the `WPKirk()->view()` method as a second parameter.

In the `resources/views/blade/demo.blade.php` file, you can use the data passed to the view like this:

```php copy
<div class="wp-kirk wrap wp-kirk-sample">

  <h1>Demo Blade</h1>

  @foreach ($users as $user)
    <p>user_nicename: {{ $user->user_nicename }}</p>
    <p>user_email: {{ $user->user_email }}</p>
  @endforeach

</div>  
```

We're using the [BladeOne](https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne) template engine. BladeOne is a standalone version of Blade Template Engine that uses a single PHP file and can be ported and used in different projects. It allows you to use Blade templates outside Laravel.

If you want to learn more about Blade directives, please visit the [BladeOne documentation](https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne/wiki) or the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/blade#blade-directives).
