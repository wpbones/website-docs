# Requirements

WP Bones requires PHP >= 8.1+, git, Composer, npm or yarn, and optionally WP-CLI. It supports macOS, Windows 10, and Linux. The `php bones` command should be run from a WordPress environment like Vagrant or Valet. Ensure git and Composer are installed in the WordPress environment, while npm is needed on the host machine for Gulp. Visit related websites for Composer, npm, Laravel, or Gulp if you're unfamiliar with them.

## Developer Tools

WP Bones has a few system requirements. However, if you are a newbie in [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), please, visit the related website before continuing.

- PHP >= 8.1+
- git
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/#installing)

<Callout>
  The WP-CLI is not mandatory but it is very useful. Anyway, if you
  want to run the scripts `make-pot` and `make-json` used to translate
  the plugin, you need to install it.

## Operating System Requirements

WP Bones supports macOS, Windows 10, and Linux distributions.

## WordPress environment

The `php bones` command should be run from your WordPress environment (in the [Vagrant](https://github.com/gfazioli/VagrantUbuntu) or [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet) environment) because it will load WordPress. Also, make sure to install `git` and `composer` in your WordPress environment. In your host machine (Mac or PC), you can install `npm`. It is used only by `gulp`.
