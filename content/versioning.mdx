# Versioning

This document explains the versioning strategy for WP Bones, which follows Semantic Versioning guidelines. Releases are numbered in the format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major version, new additions without breaking compatibility bump the minor version, and bug fixes bump the patch version. The document provides examples and links to more information on Semantic Versioning and Bower versioning.

## Overview

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards compatibility, this code will be maintained under the **Semantic Versioning guidelines** as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

Example: `1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
- New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
