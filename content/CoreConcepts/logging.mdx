# Logging

This document explains how to use logging in WP Bones. It describes enabling logging in WordPress by modifying the `wp-config.php` file and creating a `debug.log` file in the `wp-content` folder. WP Bones provides an advanced logging system with different levels such as `debug`, `info`, `warning`, and `error`. The document also covers configuring logging behavior in the `config/plugin.php` file, including setting the logging type and level.

## Overview

To help you learn more about what's happening within your plugin, you can use the `error_log()` function. As you know, within WordPress, you can enable logging by adding the following lines in the `wp-config.php` file:

```php filename="wp-config.php" copy
/**
 * For developers: WordPress debugging mode.
 *
 * Change this to true to enable the display of notices during development.
 * It is strongly recommended that plugin and theme developers use WP_DEBUG
 * in their development environments.
 */
 define('WP_DEBUG', true);
 define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
 define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
 ini_set('display_errors', 0 );
```

This will create a `debug.log` file in the `/wp-content/` folder. However, this is not the best way to log messages in your plugin. 

WP Bones provides a more advanced logging system that allows you to log messages with different levels, such as `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and so on.

Remember to enable the logging in the `wp-config.php` file as shown above. Otherwise, the WP Bones logger will not work.
</Callout>

## Configuration

In the `config/plugin.php` file, you can configure the logging behavior of your plugin. You can set the logging type and the logging level.

```php filename="config/plugin.php" copy
<?php
if (!defined("ABSPATH")) {
  exit();
}

return [
  /*
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Logging Configuration
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | Here you may configure the log settings for your plugin.
  |
  */

  "logging" => [
    /**
     * Type of log.
     * Available Settings: "single", "daily", "errorlog".
     *
     * - "errorlog", the log will be saved in the default WordPress log file.
     * Usually, this is located in the wp-content/debug.log file.
     *
     * - "single", the log will be saved in a single file in the log_path directory.
     * Default: [plugin-path]/storage/logs/debug.log
     *
     * - "daily", the log will be saved in a daily file in the log_path directory.
     * Default: [plugin-path]/storage/logs/[Y-m-d].log
     * Example: [plugin-path]/storage/logs/2024-10-09.log
     */
    "type" => "errorlog",

    /**
     * The path where the log will be saved.
     * Default: [plugin-path]/storage/logs/
     */
    //"path" => '',

    /**
     * Daily format.
     * Default: 'Y-m-d'
     */
    "daily_format" => 'Y-m-d',

    /**
     * The timestamp format used in the log.
     * Default: 'd-M-Y H:i:s T'
     * Example: [09-Oct-2024 12:51:22 UTC] [debug]: This is a debug message
     */
    "timestamp_format" => 'd-M-Y H:i:s T',
  ],
  ...
];
```
### Configuration options

- **`type`**: The type of log. You can set it to `errorlog`, `single`, or `daily`.
- **`path`**: The path where the log will be saved. By default, it is set to `[plugin-path]/storage/logs/`.
- **`daily_format`**: The daily format for the log file. By default, it is set to `Y-m-d`.
- **`timestamp_format`**: The timestamp format used in the log. By default, it is set to `d-M-Y H:i:s T`.


## Log provider

The log provider is accessible through multiple methods, making it a versatile option that serves as an excellent alternative to the traditional `error_log()` function. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable approach for their specific needs, enhancing the overall logging experience and improving error handling in their applications.

### Accessing the log provider

You can access the log provider in several ways:

- **Global Plugin Instance Function**: You can access the log provider through the global plugin instance function and use the `log()` method.
- **Log Class**: You can access the log provider through the `Log` class and use the various logging methods.
- **Helper Function**: You can access the log provider through the [`wpbones_logger()`](/docs/helpers#wpbones_logger) function and use the various logging methods.

```php copy filename="1. by using the Plugin instance function"
class MyClass {

  public function myMethod()
  {
    // By using the Plugin instance function
    WPKirk()->log()->debug( 'info', [ 'context' => 'any' ] );
  }
}
```

```php copy filename="2. by using the Log class"
use YourNamespace\WPBones\Foundation\Log\Log;

class MyClass {

  public function myMethod()
  {
    // By using the Log class
    Log::debug( 'info', [ 'context' => 'any' ] );
  }
}
```

```php copy filename="3. by using the helper function"
wpbones_logger()->debug('Hello, World');
```

### Logging Levels

The log provider supports the eight logging levels defined in the [RFC 5424 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424): emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info, and debug.


```ansi filename="Example log output"
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:22 UTC] [38;5;200m[EMERGENCY]: Your message [0m
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:23 UTC] [38;5;1m[ALERT]: Your message [0m
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:24 UTC] [38;5;1m[CRITICAL]: Your message [0m
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:25 UTC] [38;5;1m[ERROR]: Your message [0m
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:26 UTC] [38;5;211m[WARNING]: Your message [0m
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:27 UTC] [38;5;3m[NOTICE]: Your message [0m
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:28 UTC] [38;5;4m[INFO]: Your message [0m
[09-Oct-2024 17:25:29 UTC] [38;5;7m[DEBUG]: Your message [0m
```

#### Filtering log messages

The logging levels are color-coded for easy identification. In addition, they are useful for filtering and categorizing log messages based on their severity. For example, you may use a `grep` command to filter out specific log levels. Or find a specific log message in a large log file.

```bash copy filename="Filtering log messages"
tail -f /path/to/debug.log | grep -E '\[ERROR\]|\[CRITICAL\]'
```

### Messages and parameters

Usually, the log method accepts two parameters: the message and an array of context data. The context data can be any information you want to log, such as an array, object, or string.

```php copy
wpbones_logger()->debug('Hello, World', [ 'context' => 'any' ]);
```
```ansi filename="Example log output"
[10-Oct-2024 06:03:34 UTC] [38;5;7m[DEBUG]: Hello, World {
    "context": "any"
}[0m
```

## Save log files

Instead of using <Badge component="span" color="tomato" size="lg">only</Badge> the default WordPress log file, you can store the WP Bones logs into a file in the `/storage/logs/` folder within your plugin folder. You can configure the log file type in the `config/plugin.php` file.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘†">
If you decide to change the `type` setting to `single` or `daily`, you still will be able to see the log messages in the WordPress log file. The WP Bones logger will write the log messages to the file and in the `error_log` channel as well.
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ˜Ž">
    Of course, in the WP Bones log file, you will find only the messages from the WP Bones logger. This means that you will not see the messages from the `error_log()` function. And you will not see any WordPress and PHP errors or notices.
  </Callout>
</Callout>

### Configuring the logging type

By default, the channel driver is set to `errorlog`. This means that you'll find the WP Bones log in the default WordPress log file, usually `/wp-content/debug.log`. You may use the `single` or `daily` driver as well. In this case, you'll find the log file in the `/storage/logs/` folder within your plugin folder.

```php copy filename="config/plugin.php"
"logging" => [
  "type" => "single",
  "path" => null,
  "daily_format" => 'Y-m-d',
  "timestamp_format" => 'd-M-Y H:i:s T',
],
```

The `single` channel driver will create a single log file in `/storage/logs/debug.log`.

The `daily` channel driver will create a daily log file in `/storage/logs/20180401.log`.

### Configuring the log path

Of course, you can change the log path in the `config/plugin.php` file. By default, the log path is set to `{$plugin->basePath}/storage/logs/` within your plugin folder.

```php copy filename="config/plugin.php"
"logging" => [
  "type" => "single",
  "path" => "../logs/",
  "daily_format" => 'Y-m-d',
  "timestamp_format" => 'd-M-Y H:i:s T',
],
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘†">
To use the default path (in general that is true for the all configurations in the `config/plugin.php` file), comment out the `path` setting.

```php copy filename="config/plugin.php"
"logging" => [
  "type" => "single",
  //"path" => "",
  "daily_format" => 'Y-m-d',
  "timestamp_format" => 'd-M-Y H:i:s T',
],
```
</Callout>

### Configuring the daily format

You can change the daily format in the `config/plugin.php` file. By default, the daily format is set to `Y-m-d`.

```php copy filename="config/plugin.php"
"logging" => [
  "type" => "daily",
  "daily_format" => 'Y-m-d',
  "timestamp_format" => 'd-M-Y H:i:s T',
],
```
#### Tips for the daily format

If you want to create a log file for each hour, you can set the daily format to `Y-m-d-H`. This will create a log file for each hour.

##### Per hour

```php copy filename="config/plugin.php"
"logging" => [
  "type" => "daily",
  "daily_format" => 'Y-m-d-H',
  "timestamp_format" => 'd-M-Y H:i:s T',
],
```

##### With prefix name

You may also add a prefix by using the `|` pipe character. For example, if you want to create a log file for each hour with a prefix, you can set the daily format to `my-log-|Y-m-d`.

```php copy filename="config/plugin.php"
"logging" => [
  "type" => "daily",
  "daily_format" => 'my-log-|Y-m-d',
  "timestamp_format" => 'd-M-Y H:i:s T',
],
```
You will get the log file with the name `my-log-2024-10-09.log`.
