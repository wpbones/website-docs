# Architecture Foundations

This document explains the architecture foundations of a WP Bones plugin. It covers the request lifecycle, starting with the main plugin file `{plugin-name}.php`, which contains WordPress comments to identify the plugin. The main file is renamed by WP Bones based on the plugin name. It also discusses the default plugin structure, which provides a flexible starting point for organizing both large and small plugins, similar to Laravel, with no restrictions on class locations as long as Composer can autoload them.

## Request Lifecycle

The entry point is the `<plugin name>/{plugin-name}.php`. The `{plugin-name}.php` contains the WordPress comments used to identify the plugin:

```php copy
<?php

/**
 * Plugin Name: WP Kirk
 * Plugin URI: https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk
 * Description: WP Bones template WordPress plugin
 * Version: 1.6.0
 * Requires at least: 6.2
 * Requires PHP: 7.4
 * Author: Giovambattista Fazioli
 * Author URI: https://wpbones.com/
 * License: GPLv2 or later
 * License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Text Domain: wp-kirk
 * Domain Path: languages
 *
 */
```

As you know, you may use any filename for your main PHP file. In fact, WordPress will recognize the main plugin file by the PHP comment in the file head. 
The main plugin file will be renamed to `your-plugin.php` by the WP Bones command line tool. For example, if you create a plugin named `My Plugin`, the main file will be `my-plugin.php`.
See [Get plugin information](#get-plugin-information) for more details.

So, the entry point of a plugin is `{your-plugin-name}.php`.

Of course, you can edit the `{your-plugin-name}.php` file to set your WordPress comment information. The rest of the code is handled by WP Bones.

## Plugin Structure

The default WP Bones plugin structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small plugins. Of course, you are free to organize your application as you like. Similarly, Laravel, WP Bones imposes almost no restrictions on where any given class is located - as long as Composer can autoload the class.

### The root directory

Let's look at a default standard WP Bones plugin folder tree:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myPlugin" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="bootstrap" color="yellow">bootstrapping framework and autoloading</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="config">contains all of your configuration plugin's files</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="database">contains your database migration</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="languages">contains the `.mo` and `.pot` to localize your plugin</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="plugin">contains the core code of your plugin</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="public">contains the front controller and your assets</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="resources">contains your views, raw assets</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="vendor" color="red">contains (at this moment) the WP Bones Framework</FileTreeLabel>} />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Additional directories

You may use the following additional directories:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myPlugin" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="api">contains your REST API endpoints</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="pages">contains your plugin's custom page</FileTreeLabel>} />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Callout type="info">
Check out [REST API](/docs/ServicesProvider/rest-api) and [custom pages](pages-routing#custom-admin-pages-folder) for more information.
</Callout>

### The root files

Also, you will find a set of files in the root of the plugin:


<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myPlugin" defaultOpen >
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="bones" color="orange">command line PHP script</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="composer.json" color="yellow">used by composer</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="composer.lock" color="red">used by composer</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="gulpfile.js">script used by Gulp</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="{your-plugin-name}.php">entry point of plugin</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="namespace" color="red">used by bones command</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="package.json">used by npm</FileTreeLabel>} />
    <FileTree.File name={<FileTreeLabel type="file" name="readme.txt">WordPress readme file</FileTreeLabel>} />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- The `bones` file is the command line PHP script, likewise `artisan` in Laravel environment.
-  The `composer.json` and `composer.lock` are used by Composer.
-  The `gulpfile.js` is the script used by Gulp. This file is prepared with the main tasks to process styles and scripts. Before using it, you should install Gulp and npm.
-  The `{your-plugin-name}.php` is the entry point of the plugin.
-  The `namespace` is a file used by the bones command. You can ignore it.
-  The `package.json` is used by npm. Feel free to add your own packages.
-  The `readme.txt` is the WordPress readme file to be used when you'll submit your plugin to the WordPress repository.

### The plugin directory

However, the most important folder is `/plugin/`. In this folder, you will find the main controllers of your plugin:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my_plugin" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="plugin" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="Ajax" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="CustomPostTypes" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="CustomTaxonomyTypes" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="Http" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="Shortcodes" />
      <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="hooks" color="yellow">available as optional starting v1.8</FileTreeLabel>} />
      <FileTree.Folder name={<FileTreeLabel name="modules" color="yellow">available as optional starting v1.8</FileTreeLabel>} />
      <FileTree.File name="activation.php" />
      <FileTree.File name="deactivation.php" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


### The config directory

All of the configuration files for the plugin are stored in the `config/` directory. Each option is self-documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="myPlugin" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="config" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="menus.php" />
      <FileTree.File name="plugin.php" />
      <div>...</div>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

In the WP Kirk template plugin, you will find a sample `custom.php` file. This file contains:

```php copy
<?php

if (!defined('ABSPATH')) {
    exit();
}

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Custom configuration
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This is an example of a custom configuration. You may get this configuration
| by plugin instance.
| For example, in a view you can use `$this->config( 'custom.sample' )`.
|
*/

return [
  'sample' => 'Hello, Captain!'
];
```

It's very easy to get a custom configuration by using `$pluginInstance->config( 'custom.sample') `.

## Plugin instance

The plugin instance is the most important object in WP Bones.
You will be able to get the plugin instance by using either `WPKirk()` function or the global static class `WPKirk`.

```php copy
// plugin instance by global unique function
echo WPKirk()->Author;

// plugin instance by global static class
echo WPKirk::$plugin->Author;

```

Of course, if your plugin is named `MyPlugin` you will use `MyPlugin()` to get the instance. Same for the static class `echo WPKirk::$plugin->Author;`

### Get plugin information

In the `{your-plugin-name}.php` file you may use the comment to insert some plugin information:

```php copy filename="{your-plugin-name}.php"
<?php

/**
 * Plugin Name: WP Kirk
 * Plugin URI: https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk

```

You can get this information by using the **plugin instance**:

```php copy
echo $plugin->Author;
echo $plugin->TextDomain;
```
