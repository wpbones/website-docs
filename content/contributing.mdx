## How to Contribute

Contributing to the WP Bones framework is a great way to help improve the project and support the WordPress community. Here are some ways you can contribute:

<Steps>

### Fork the WP Bones repository

1. Go to the [WP Bones GitHub repository](https://github.com/wpbones/wpbones).
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

Clone your forked repository to your local machine in your desired location. This folder will serve as the destination for the WP Bones framework. You may also create a new branch for your changes.


```sh copy
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wpbones.git <forked-repo>
cd <forked-repo>
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### Clone a WP Kirk repository

Due to the nature of the WP Bones framework, and the WordPress ecosystem, it is recommended to clone any WP Kirk boilerplate to get started. This will provide you with a solid foundation for your development work. We recommend using the [WP Kirk Boilerplate](https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk-Boilerplate) as a starting point.

Follow the instructions in the [Installation](/docs/GettingStarted/installation) and remember **DO NOT RENAME AND CHANGE THE NAMESPACE** of the plugin folder.

```sh copy
git clone -b main https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk-Boilerplate.git <your-plugin-folder>
```

You can now use this plugin to edit the WP Bones framework in the `vendor/wpbones/wpbones` folder. You may also modify the `bones` command in the root of the plugin.

### Make your changes

You can now modify the WP Bones framework. Ensure you follow best practices and coding standards when making changes.

### Copy/sync your changes

You can copy or sync your changes to the original forked repository. Begin from the root of your boilerplate plugin folder.

```sh copy
cd <your-plugin-folder>
```
```sh copy
rsync -aE --delete --exclude=".git/" "vendor/wpbones/wpbones/" "<forked-repo>/WPBones/"
```

<Callout emoji="üí°">
Certainly, you can use any tool you prefer for syncing files, like `rsync`, `cp`, or another file synchronization tool. 

- For instance, [Kaleidoscope](https://kaleidoscope.app/) is excellent for comparing and syncing files. 
- If you are using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), you can install the [Sync Folders](https://www.raycast.com/Undolog/sync-folders) extension to sync files easily.

We already planned to add a `bones sync` command to the WP Bones framework, which will automate this process in the future.
</Callout>

If you have modified the `bones` command, you need to copy those changes too.

```sh copy
cp bones <forked-repo>/WPBones/src/Console/bin/bones
```

### Commit your changes

Now you can commit your changes to the forked repository. Make sure to write clear and descriptive commit messages.

```sh copy
cd <forked-repo>
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```
### Push your changes
```sh copy
git push origin my-feature-branch
```
### Create a pull request
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Pull requests" tab.
3. Click the "New pull request" button.
4. Select the branch you created and compare it with the main branch of the WP Bones repository.
5. Add a title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you made and why they are important.
6. Click the "Create pull request" button.  

</Steps>

## Framework Bug Reports

When encountering issues with software or applications, submitting a detailed bug report can significantly help developers in understanding and resolving the problem efficiently. A well-written bug report should include clear steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the actual outcome. 

Furthermore, providing information such as system specifications, error messages, and screenshots can aid in pinpointing the root cause of the bug. By utilizing platforms like GitHub, users can create issue tickets with relevant details, facilitating effective communication between users and developers. Remember, a comprehensive bug report not only assists in bug resolution but also improves the overall quality of the software.
