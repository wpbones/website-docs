# Menus Routing

This document explains menu routing in WP Bones, which differs from Laravel's routing system. It supports basic HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Examples show how to define routes for different HTTP methods and handle form method spoofing for unsupported actions. Additionally, it introduces the `resource` key for calling default methods in view controllers, simplifying route definitions by using standard methods like `index` and `store`.

## Overview

In WordPress as well as WP Bones architecture, the routing is quite different from Laravel. Instead of a true routing system, there is menu routing. However, you can still handle basic HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. In the example above, we used the `get` verb in the `route` key. If your view contains a form with a POST method, you can use:

```php copy
...
  'route' => [
    'get'  => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@secondMenu',
    'post' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@updateValues'
  ]
...  
```

In this case, when an HTTP POST request is made, the method `updateValues` in `Dashboard\DashboardController` will be called.

## Form Method Spoofing

HTML forms do not support `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` actions. So, when defining `PUT`, `PATCH` or`DELETE` routes that are called from an HTML form, you will need to add a hidden `_method` field to the form. The value sent with the `_method` field will be used in the HTTP request:

```html copy
<form action="" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">
</form>
```

## Resource

Alternatively, instead of specifying each single HTTP verb, you may use the `resource` key in order to call the default method in your view controller:

```php copy
...
  'route' => [ 'resource' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController' ],
...
```

Once you have assigned the view controller to a given route resource, you may use the standard methods instead.

```php copy
class DashboardResourceController extends Controller {
  
  // GET
  public function index() {
    //
  }
  
  // POST
  public function store() {
    //
  }
  
  // PUT AND PATCH
  public function update() {
    //
  }

  // DELETE
  public function destroy() {
    //
  }
}
```

You can use the `php bones` command to create a controller:

```sh copy
php bones make:controller MyController
```

Create the folder and namespace

```sh copy
php bones make:controller Billing/Market/MyController
```

## Redirect in load

When a submenu is clicked, your controller's methods are executed inside the admin view. This means that the HTTP headers are already sent. So, you can't execute any HTTP redirect but only a script - workaround - redirect. Anyway, WP Bones provides a redirect method that you may use. If the headers are already sent, a JavaScript script redirect will be done:

```php copy
// POST
public function store() {
  // your store command
  $this->redirect( 'some url' );
}
```

Also, WP Bones provides a special route called `load`. It is executed before the page is rendered:

```php copy
...
  'route' => [ 'load' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@load' ],
...
```

<Callout>
You will need to use this method to add meta boxes.
</Callout>



```php copy
public function load()
{
    wp_enqueue_script( 'common' );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'wp-lists' );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'postbox' );
    
    // TODO: add your meta boxes
}
```

This route will be called on the `load-{hook}` action. Here you can use `wp_redirect()` or the WP Bones redirect method. Let's see an example:

```html copy
<form action="" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="_redirect" value="http://undolog.com">
  <button class="button">POST with redirect</button>
</form>
```

In the `load` method of the controller:

```php copy
public function load()
{
  if( $this->request->get( '_redirect' ) ) {
    // the wp_redirect() will be done
    $this->redirect( $this->request->get( '_redirect' ) );
  }
}
```
