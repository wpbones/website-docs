 * sends it away from both. Ported from findergit.app's `guide.ts`, which took
 * it from netfox.app's, whose fox works the same way.
 *
 * Module state survives a client navigation and is gone on a reload: once
 * dismissed it does not come back when the reader returns to the home page
 * through a link, and a reload brings it back, as lancetta.app's and
 * netfox.app's do (user, 2026-09-24, on lancetta.app: "facciamolo apparire
 * sempre ad ogni reload della pagina").
