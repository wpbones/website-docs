/**
 * The mascot in the docs, beside a speech bubble: to welcome a reader, or to
 * point at the thing worth knowing on a page. Used here and there, never on
 * every page, or it stops being a moment.
 *
 * No JavaScript: a server component around the same sprite the home page
 * walks (`Mascot`). The bubble's words are the page's own text, so a crawler
 * and a screen reader get them like any paragraph; the drawing is decoration
 * and says nothing (`aria-hidden` on the svg). Its one motion is CSS: a hop as
 * the page lands and on hover, and none under Reduce Motion.
 *
 * On the right, pointing, the raised arm reaches up and left toward the
 * bubble; on the left, pointing reads as a wave. Ported from findergit.app's
 * `MascotNote`.
