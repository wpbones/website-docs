/**
 * The promo films' spring, sampled for CSS.
 *
 * The films of the sibling apps write every move as the closed-form step
 * response of a damped spring -- a frequency `f` in Hz and a damping ratio
 * `zeta` -- which is also what SwiftUI's `spring(response: 1 / f,
 * dampingFraction: zeta)` runs in the apps. CSS cannot run a spring, but
 * `linear()` runs any curve sampled finely enough, so every spring this site
 * uses is sampled here into `theme/global.css`, each with its duration: the
 * time its envelope takes to fall under 0.4%. A curve and its duration only
 * make sense as a pair, which is why neither is typed by hand.
 *
 * `springs.test.ts` fails when the stylesheet and this file disagree, and
 * prints the block to paste. The positive control is netfox.app (its #77):
 * its three springs, sampled this way, come out identical to the last digit,
 * and lancetta.app runs the same three -- so the three sites move alike.
 * Cross-ported from lancetta-website on 2026-09-28.
 *
 * Nothing here runs a Web Animation yet. If something does, it takes its
 * spring from this file (lancetta-website's `springFor` is the shape), never
 * from the stylesheet: minified, `879ms` is served as `.879s`, and on
 * lancetta.app `parseFloat` read that as 0.879 ms, so a spring-back lasted
 * under a millisecond in production only.
